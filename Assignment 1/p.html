    <h1>&lt;p&gt; element</h1>
    <hr>
    The &lt;p&gt; HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.
