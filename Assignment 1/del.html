    <h1>&lt;del&gt; element</h1>
    <hr>
    The &lt;del&gt; HTML element represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document. This can be used when rendering "track changes" or source code diff information, for example. The &lt;ins&gt; element can be used for the opposite purpose: to indicate text that has been added to the document.
